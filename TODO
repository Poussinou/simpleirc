The great Atomic TODO list
------------------------------------------

Things that are actively problems:

* No tab-complete button for devices without a hardware tab-complete.
* Keyboard has problems in landscape mode (thanks, Android!)
* Let the user type after disconnect

Future improvements:
 
 * Allow for auto-reconnect when 3G drops out.
 * Prompt for newline management
 * A firstrun wizard. (+1 badjillion)
 * DOC. YOO. MEN. TAY. SHUNN. Let's spell it out, folks.
 * Jellybean type message buttons inside the service message.
 
 Bluesky features:
 
* Loading colorschemes from the SD card. 
* a DashClock plugin (ooh!)

SRS Notes:

 There are plenty of places in the source tree that need to be documented and
 made less insane. Much of the source takes advantage of the Android Dalvik
 runtime stack manipulation:
 
 public int foo( )
 {
	int r = 5;
	return r;
 }
 
 This causes some stack magic: r will be kicked around as a reference until it
 is used in a function call. Do this when possible.
