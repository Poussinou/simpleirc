			<p>Many things have changed since the initial fork. This guide will show you some of the things that have changed between yaaic and Atomic.</p>
        	<p>Several large changes have happened that stand out from the rest.</p>
        	<img src="nick_complete.png" />
        	<p>A button has been added for nick completion. This is availible to all users, not just ones without physical search keys.</p>
        	<img src="event_icons.png" />
        	<p>Nearly every icon and graphic has been revamped using the Holo style from Google.</p>
        	<img src="smileys.png" />
        	<p>Smileys and other features are still there, however.  (This is not on by default)</p>

    <string name="helptopic_colorschemes_body"><![CDATA[
        <p>Simple IRC features a selection of color schemes. There are a wide selection of schemes, the majority based on the Base16 color schemes from Chris Kempson.</p>
        <p>If you are coming from a previous release of Atomic, your color scheme will be reverted to the default.</p>
        <p>A selection of the color schemes available</p>
        
        <img src="colorschemes.png" />
        <p>All color schemes have two variants: Dark and Light. AMOLED users may find it adventageous to use the dark style, as it will conserve power.</p>
        <p>You can also use the Dark color scheme, to not blind you at night.</p>
